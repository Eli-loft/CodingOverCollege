        <p>
          Welcome to Coding Over College.
        </p>
        <p> 
          The overarching chapter tabs—Data Structures, Named Algorithms, Python Libraries, and more—are 
          divided into subcategories, each containing topics relevant to their respective chapters. 
          The goal of this project is to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to advanced topics, 
          offering not only enough to get you started but also enough to keep you going.
          This project has been a long time in the making. I derived much of my inspiration from W3Schools, 
          and I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already. They are my top reference, listed under the 
          References tab. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="section-title">Inspiration</h2>     
        <p>
            
          As I sit in my Data Analytics with Python class, I watch my teacher attempt to cover the entire Python language in a 
          two-hour lecture. I can't help but think—there must be a better way to learn alongside him. That thought led me to 
          hatch a plan: to create a website that simplifies complex jargon in the field while serving as a hub for libraries, 
          algorithms, and data structures, ensuring that developers don’t have to reinvent the wheel.
          My goal is not only to provide a resource for beginners who want a deeper understanding of Python and computer science 
          as a whole but also to refine my own knowledge in the process. I firmly believe that you don’t truly understand 
          something until you can explain a high-level concept to a fifth grader.
          My hope is that anyone reading this develops the same passion for the craft that I hold myself. 
          In a time of growing uncertainty in the field, I want to personally thank those who take the time to learn. 
          Don’t be discouraged—you can learn.
        </p>
