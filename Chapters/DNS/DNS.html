          <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 1: Introduction to DNS</h2>

          <h3>What is DNS?</h3>
          <p>
            Provides a clear definition of DNS and how it fits into the broader
            networking ecosystem. Explains the fundamental role DNS plays,
            comparing it to a “phone book” that maps human-readable domain names
            to IP addresses.
          </p>

          <h3>Basic Terminology</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Domain names:</strong> How we label websites and services (e.g., google.com).</li>
            <li><strong>IP addresses:</strong> The “addresses” computers use to reach each other (both IPv4 and IPv6).</li>
            <li><strong>DNS records:</strong> Various types of records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) that hold domain info.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            By the end of this chapter, readers will understand why DNS is important,
            how it arose out of the need to make the internet more user-friendly, and
            the basic terms essential for further study.

        <!-- Chapter 2 -->
        <section id="chapter2">
          <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 2: How DNS Works</h2>

          <h3>DNS Resolvers</h3>
          <p>
            Differentiates between recursive and iterative resolvers. Demonstrates
            how a typical DNS query flows from a user’s computer to the DNS
            infrastructure, possibly going through multiple steps.
          </p>

          <h3>DNS Caching</h3>
          <p>
            Explores how caching improves performance by storing recent DNS lookups.
            Covers the importance of TTL (Time to Live) and how caching can both speed
            up and occasionally complicate DNS resolution.
          </p>

          <h3>Zone Files</h3>
          <p>
            Looks at how domain information is stored in zone files. Showcases common
            DNS record types in practice (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.).
          </p>

          <p>
            This chapter connects the definitions from Chapter 1 to the actual
            mechanics of DNS queries. Readers will see what happens behind the scenes
            when they type a website address into a browser or ping a domain from the
            command line.

        <!-- Chapter 3 -->
        <section id="chapter3">
          <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 3: Basic Networking Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            While DNS is a critical piece of the internet puzzle, it doesn’t exist in isolation.
            This chapter covers broader networking basics:
          </p>

          <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
          <p>
            Covers both IPv4 and IPv6 formats. Explains why IPv6 is increasingly important
            and how DNS integrates with it.
          </p>

          <h3>Protocols</h3>
          <p>
            Delves into UDP vs. TCP, explaining why DNS primarily uses UDP for queries
            and in which cases it might use TCP.
          </p>

          <h3>Ports</h3>
          <p>
            Highlights the well-known port numbers used by DNS (e.g., port 53 for both
            TCP and UDP), plus how firewalls/routers handle DNS traffic.
          </p>

          <p>
            This foundational knowledge helps readers understand why DNS works the way
            it does and how it fits into the broader internet architecture.
